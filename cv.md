## Profile

I am ambitious and motivated to become a Front-end developer. I am currently actively studying basic technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript and am quickly mastering them. My desire to develop in this field is supported by diligent projects and tasks that I perform independently. I am looking for an opportunity to join a team where I can use my skills and gain new experience to become a successful Front-end developer.
